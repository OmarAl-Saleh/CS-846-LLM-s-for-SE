Dr. Bob Kelso:
Hi team,
Great kickoff meeting. To summarize, we need this system live by the Fall semester. The current system of paper tickets is a disaster.
My vision is "Zero Friction." I want students to drive in, and the gate just opens. Like magic.
Also, we need a "VIP Mode" for faculty. I want to be able to reserve a spot near the building before I even leave my house.

Requirements Engineer:
Thanks, Bob. Regarding "Zero Friction" and the gate opening automatically—are we assuming we will use RFID tags, or were you thinking of License Plate Recognition (LPR)?
Also, for the VIP reservation, should the system hold the spot physically (with a barrier) or just digitally count it as taken?

Dr. Bob Kelso:
No RFID. Too expensive to mail tags to 20,000 students. Let's use cameras. The AI should just read the plate and open the gate.
For the VIP spots—just digital is fine. If a student parks in a reserved spot, the system should know and maybe issue a fine automatically?
Oh, and obviously, it needs to work on iPhones and Androids. The app should let them pay for monthly passes too.

Requirements Engineer:
Understood. So, LPR for entry, digital reservations for faculty, and mobile payments.
Quick question: Does the camera system need to work for visitors (non-students) too?

Dr. Bob Kelso:
Visitors are tricky. Just let them pull a paper ticket for now if they don't have the app. We can phase that out later.
But the main priority is the monthly pass holders getting in fast.
