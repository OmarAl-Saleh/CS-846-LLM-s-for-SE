Tony Micelli:
I heard you guys are talking about "automatic entry."
Look, I don't care about the apps. My problem is delivery trucks.
We have Sysco food trucks and FedEx coming in 50 times a day. They don't have "student accounts" and they can't fit in the visitor lane because the turns are too tight.
The system needs a way for my security guard in the booth to manually open any gate from his desktop computer.

Requirements Engineer:
Hi Tony, valid point. We will add a "Manual Override" feature for the guard station.
Does the guard station have a computer with a reliable network connection to the server?

Tony Micelli:
Yeah, he has a PC. Windows 10.
Another thing—what happens when the power goes out? We get brownouts here a lot in the winter.
If the power dies, the barriers need to default to "Open." Last year they defaulted to "Locked" and we trapped 500 cars during a snowstorm.
Safety first.

Requirements Engineer:
Understood. Fail-safe "Open" state.
By the way, Bob mentioned fining students automatically if they park in a reserved spot. Do you have cameras inside the lot to see _which_ spot a car takes?

Tony Micelli:
What? No. We only have cameras at the entrance/exit.
Once they are inside, I have no idea where they park. Bob is dreaming if he thinks we can track individual slots without installing 2,000 sensors.
